I wrote this blog, opened with coding 

```
javascript
function IAmAnEnginer() {
 console.log("I'm proud of the vocational school");
}
```

I was born from a vocational womb, precisely at telkom university. being a vocational person is not the ideal I crave. My dream is just to be an airplane pilot and be able to walk to the end of the world. but, god gives way, which I can't predict. what I asked for is not necessarily what I need.

In 2015. I went to Bandung to take the telkom selection test. long story short, I was accepted in diploma Telecommunications techniques. which I myself do not year what telecommunications means. at that time I asked my friend named fahri. "what is telecommunications ri?", asked me. "that wan, you'll learn about the signal". in my heart I think. "Signal!?, what kind of animal it is."

My first class in August 2015. The first lesson I took was **basic telecommunication engineering**, my first course was mastered by a lecturer, named  yulisun. the term I heard and I am not familiar with is, Tx and Rx. "So, telecommunications is learning about how we can connect people remotely". That's about how I first heard from the study. 

in this first year, there are many activities that I have to do. tasks of the lab. and many practicum schedules. studying in a diploma is different from studying at bachelor. Why? because most of the practice, it feels like college while playing.

Yupss, play. for me learning while playing it was a lot of fun. but I admit. Telecommunication diploma is good. the lecturer gave an optimism to his students. Because they understand, getting into a diploma is like having no future. the lecturers at the diploma encouraged us. I'm so happy.

> when I shouted "Diploma telecommunication engineering", you answered: "able, able, can!"
