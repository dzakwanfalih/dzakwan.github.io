<p>Hi there! I’m Dzakwan Falih, a graduate student Telkom University in the Faculty of Applied Sience . I am interested in the broader topics of Telecommunication, Malware, mobile programming and solution architect . Currently, I am focused on software define radio, open source mobile communication, and internet of everything. See Current Research Interests.</p>

<h3 id="radio-forensic">Radio Forensic</h3>

<p>The field of digital forensics has expanded to include network forensics as well, and includes such areas of expertise as investigating network security breaches, hacking attempts, and data theft.</p>

<p>With the introduction of computer processing into other devices, such as global positioning system (GPS) units, automobiles, truck black boxes, cellular phones, answering machines, copy and fax machines, and so forth, the field has expanded to add additional subdisciplines.</p>

<p>Each of the subdisciplines can be part of a digital forensic examiner’s expertise, but not all have to be. Some examiners choose to specialize in one area, such as computer forensics, without ever adding cellular phone forensics or GPS to their repertoire of skills.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="malware">Malware</h3>
<p>Malware analysis is the process of understanding the behavior and purpose of a suspicious file or URL. The output of the analysis aids in the detection and mitigation of the potential threat.</p>

<p>Mobile malware is malicious software specifically designed to target mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, with the goal of gaining access to private data.</p>

<p>Although mobile malware is not currently as pervasive as malware that attacks traditional workstations, it’s a growing threat because many companies now allow employees to access corporate networks using their personal devices, potentially bringing unknown threats into the environment.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="solution-architect">Solution Architect</h3>

<p>Solution architecture is a practice of designing, describing, and managing the solution engineering in relation to specific business problems. A solution architect is the person in charge of leading the practice and introducing the overall technical vision for a particular solution.While the practice can be managed in-house, there are companies that provide solution architecture consulting as a specific set of services.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="internet-of-everything">Internet of Everything</h3>

<p>The Internet of Everything (IoE) with four pillars: people, process, data, and things builds on top of The Internet of Things (IoT) with one pillar: things. In addition, IoE further advances the power of the Internet to improve business and industry outcomes, and ultimately make people’s lives better by adding to the progress of IoT.</p>

<p>The Internet of Everything will create tens of millions of new objects and sensors, all generating real-time data. “Data is money,” said Nick Jones, research vice president and distinguished analyst at Gartner. “Businesses will need big data and storage technologies to collect, analyze and store the sheer volume of information. Furthermore, to turn data into money business and IT leaders will need decisions. As they won’t have the time or the capacity to make all the decisions themselves they will need processing power.”</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="mobile-programming">Mobile programming</h3>
<p>The research goal of this work is to improve the understanding of the current trends in mobile applicationsoftware engineering research and exploring the gap between published research and some open issues in mobileapplication software engineering</p>
