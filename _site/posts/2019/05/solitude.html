        <p>I’ve been spending a lot of time alone on this <a href="/travel/">road trip</a>. Both on this trip and over the past few years, I’ve been thinking a lot about solitude, specifically with respect to not having a romantic partner. I’ve been surprised with what I’ve learned recently. In my mind, there’s four different flavors of being alone:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Being alone, being not okay with it, and wishing you were with someone else.</strong> This is basically every high school girl who hasn’t been kissed yet, and also very much what society tells us every high school girl who hasn’t been kissed yet <em>should</em> be. In fact, this is <em>the</em> plot of the movie Never Been Kissed. Also, as awesome as the movie is, it’s the plot of Miss Congeniality. Or probably any rom com that you love.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Being with someone else, and therefore satisfied and happy, but underneath it actually not being okay with being alone.</strong> I imagine this is many, if not most, people who are in generic relationships. (Yes, I’m judgmental. But it’s because I have “unreasonably” high standards for partnership.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Being alone and totally satisfied.</strong> This is what I’ve been working very hard to achieve for the past year or two, and what I was expecting to really solidify through this road trip. I do feel that I confirmed this level on the first part of my road trip, most notably drinking a beer and watching the sunset at Big Bend after having said no to hanging out with a fellow traveller. Also, deep and satisfying friendships are key to unlocking this level.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Being with someone, and also totally satisfied alone.</strong> This is the surprise one, both because I didn’t realize it was possible and also because I didn’t expect to be with someone (in general or on this road trip). I’ve found myself truly deeply and fully enjoying the moments I’ve had and the things I’ve seen by myself on this trip, <em>and also</em> I’ve really missed the person I’m with – independently. I used to think that if you really liked someone and they weren’t with you on a trip, everything you saw or experienced would be colored with the thought of “I wish they were here.” What I didn’t realize was that it’s possible to divorce their not being there with my experience of the thing. One <em>doesn’t</em> have to color the other. Cool. :)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>About two years into my PhD, I realized that the field I actually wanted to be in was public health, not necessarily biological engineering. Around the same time, I also fell in love with coding and data science. That’s when I realized that combining public health and data science could be an ideal career path for my technical abilities and interests and my desire to have social impact. But immersed in the world of academia, at an institution without a school of public health, and with mentors who had all chosen routes in biotech or academia, it was really hard to learn more about my options for pivoting to a career in public health.

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>When I was on my <a href="https://cduvallet.github.io/travel/">cross-country road trip</a> last year, I kept track of a lot of things in the hopes of doing amazing analyses when I got back. Turns out having a job as a data scientist makes it a lot harder to find time to do data science on the side, and so I’ve only really gotten a chance to look into my <a href="2019/07/road-trip-expenses-pt1">expenses</a>. One of the things I had really wanted to do was make a map of all the places I went, but I didn’t actually know how to work with geospatial data in Python yet. I had this grand idea that I’d learn spatial data techniques while on my trip, but turns out hiking, drinking beer while watching the sunset, and going to bed early were way more compelling ways to spend my time. Luckily for me, one of the most fun parts of my new job has been learning geospatial coding and plotting techniques. I’ve been having fun with it in my job, and I realized that it also means I get to finally make my map!

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>During my PhD, I performed a lot of exit interviews with graduating students and learned that finding a job is often the most stressful part of graduating, and among the most stressful in the entire PhD. After my own defense, however, I was able to avoid some of that stress by discovering a valuable post-PhD job option that I had rarely heard discussed: getting a part-time or consulting gig after graduating to hold you over while you figure out your next full-time non-academic career move.
