<h2 id="arkansas">Arkansas</h2>

<h3 id="pro-tips">Pro-tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Ouachita forest: so many rec areas!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bucket-list">Bucket list</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Just all of it again but slower</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="new-mexico">New Mexico</h2>

<h3 id="pro-tips-1">Pro-tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>El Malpais was really fun. The rim trail was beautiful (but bring a friend bc it gets boring).</li>
  <li>Joe Skeen campground was probably the best free BLM camp I stayed at.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bucket-list-1">Bucket list</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Come back with caving gear and visit the lava tubes.</li>
  <li>Also do the long 7-hour hike through the middle of the badlands.</li>
  <li>Visit El Morro, but make sure to get to the campsite early because it fills up really fast.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="grand-canyon">Grand Canyon</h2>

<h3 id="pro-tips-2">Pro-tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Backcountry office is way less busy than the visitor center, it has flush toilets, and parking fills up less quickly than the visitor center</li>
  <li>camp in the forest just outside the park: you won’t be alone. If you’re not in an RV, have dinner at a picnic area <em>in</em> the park first, stop by a bathroom, and then head to the forest. Don’t lock yourself out of your car though.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bucket-list-2">Bucket list</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Tanner Trail</li>
  <li>Rim to rim hike</li>
  <li>Bright angel again, but start a bit earlier and go all the way to Plateau Point</li>
  <li>Check out the North Rim (not open all season, check the dates before going)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="north-of-grand-canyonsouth-grand-escalante-kanab-region">North of Grand canyon/South Grand Escalante, Kanab region</h2>

<h3 id="pro-tips-3">Pro-tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Badger Canyon “camp” is awesome</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bucket-list-3">Bucket list</h3>

<ul>
  <li>All of it! Spencer Lake trail for next time, but I’d definitely do Cathedral Wash again.</li>
  <li>Buckskin gulch trail (starting from Wire tap)</li>
  <li>Actually get your shit together to go do The Wave lottery (but remember: Arizona and Utah might be an hour different if it’s daylight savings!)</li>
  <li>Maybe the Peek-a-boo slot canyon that’s to the west of Kanab?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="zion-national-park">Zion National Park</h2>

<h3 id="pro-tips-4">Pro-tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Angel’s landing trail is so awesome. The hike up to the start of the exciting trail is very quick, the hike up to Angel’s Landing is also fairly short but requires a lot of waiting for other hikers, so in the end the estimated time is about accurate.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bucket-list-4">Bucket list</h3>

<ul>
  <li>as many trails as possible from the East side</li>
  <li>hike through the Narrows (with a friend who knows how to prepare for a hike through a river)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bryce-canyon-national-park">Bryce Canyon National Park</h2>

<h3 id="pro-tips-5">Pro-tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Bryce Canyon Coffee Co in Tropic is super lovely! Also attached to a motel.</li>
  <li>All of the viewpoints have parking, so if you’re early enough in the day you probably don’t need to take the shuttle. (It comes every 15 min, so it’s not as frequent as in Zion). The additional parking seems to fill up by 10 am or so.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bucket-list-5">Bucket list</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If I’m feeling like backpacking: the under-the-rim trail seems awesome.</li>
  <li>If not, figure out what the trail is that leaves from Rainbow Point and goes out to the point in front of it.</li>
  <li>Maybe try to find some hikes in the forest between Bryce and Tropic (or go back and do Red Canyon hike?)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="grand-staircase-escalante-national-monument-area">Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument area</h2>

<h3 id="pro-tips-6">Pro-tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Unlike most other areas I’ve camped in, this one has no service!</li>
  <li>Lots of washboard on the main road, and trails to find campsites are fairly rough – high clearance recommended</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bucket-list-6">Bucket list</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Petrified forest state park</li>
  <li>Willow Gulch trail, all the way to the arch at the “end”</li>
  <li>Come prepared for some overnight backpacking hikes</li>
  <li>BRING A DOG TO PLAY</li>
  <li>Come with enough time to hang around the campsite and explore the surroundings</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="road-between-grand-staircase-and-moab">Road between Grand Staircase and Moab</h2>

<h3 id="pro-tips-7">Pro-tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Omg pies at Capitol Reef what a lovely surprise! Come prepared to nom.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bucket-lists">Bucket lists</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Figure out backcountry camping and permits for the area around scenic byway 24 and go exploring</li>
  <li>Actually drive on 95 like Janyne told me to (AKA between Hanksville, Fry Canyon, and Blanding)</li>
  <li>Spend more time at Capitol Reef, but preferably only there so it doesn’t get diluted by all the other cool things nearby</li>
  <li>Re-do the Little Wild Horse slot canyon near Goblin Valley State Park, but do the whole loop and don’t die in a flash flood. Also, explore that area more and camp closer to the slot canyon hike (rather than the weird parking-lot-like BLM campsite)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="moab">Moab</h2>

<h3 id="pro-tips-8">Pro-tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure you have your shit together and book a campsite in advance, otherwise it’s very hard to find somewhere. BLM campsites are fairly small but reservable, Canyonlands is also an option.</li>
  <li>Take the road that goes along the Colorado (route 128) instead of highway 191 if you’re heading out and going northeast.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="badlands">Badlands</h2>

<h3 id="pro-tips-9">Pro-tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The campground is really cheap: $12 if you have the America the Beautiful pass, and it’s right next to a lovely diner with internet, warmth, and beer</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="black-hills">Black Hills</h2>

<h3 id="bucket-list-7">Bucket list</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Just come camping here for a trip, and hike around</li>
  <li>Mt. Rushmore, I guess…</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="yellowstone-and-grand-tetons">Yellowstone and Grand Tetons</h2>

<h3 id="pro-tips-10">Pro-tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Learn how to prepare for bears. If you want to hike, it’s better to find a friend for this part of the trip.</li>
  <li>Old Faithful erupts every ~90 minutes. There’s a couple of short hikes to do around there. Plan to be there for at least 2 or 3 eruptions if you can, since some of them are less whelming.</li>
  <li>While you’re waiting for Old Faithful, get a Huckleberry ice cream float at the cafe. Best ice cream float I’ve ever had.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bucket-list-8">Bucket list</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Hike all up in those Tetons.</li>
  <li>Also hike in Yellowstone, but with a friend who’s ready to fight bears.</li>
  <li>Bighorn forest to the east of Yellowstone is spectacular. Their slogan is “Like Yellowstone but without the crowds” and it isn’t totally inaccurate. Would be fun to go back and explore that area.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="idaho">Idaho</h2>

<h3 id="pro-tips-11">Pro-tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Idaho BLM doesn’t really have maps available, either on Avenza or in the (Idaho Falls) office. But they do have a nice booklet with recreation opportunities, which includes <em>some</em> campsites</li>
  <li>There are campsites near Swan Falls dam. I also found one at the top of the canyon which was right by the road but quite nice.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bucket-list-9">Bucket list</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Craters of the Moon national monument</li>
  <li>Apparently going North-South is pretty stupendous, and Idaho has the best wilderness areas of any state. So go find those and do that.</li>
  <li>Shoshone falls</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="california-highway-1">California highway 1</h2>

<h3 id="pro-tips-12">Pro-tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>all of the pull-outs seem to have a day use fee. Park on the side of the highway and walk in (alleviate your guilt by avoiding eye contact with the ranger)</li>
  <li>Los Padres National Forest starts near the south of Big Sur. There are signs to campgrounds up the hill, Prewitt Ridge was where I headed.</li>
  <li>Bring a friend to drive so you don’t almost kill yourself looking at the views on the windy road. (Not speaking from experience, of course…)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bucket-lists-1">Bucket lists</h3>

<ul>
  <li>All of it again but slower. But I’d need to figure out the (free) camping situation…</li>
</ul>

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>About two years into my PhD, I realized that the field I actually wanted to be in was public health, not necessarily biological engineering. Around the same time, I also fell in love with coding and data science. That’s when I realized that combining public health and data science could be an ideal career path for my technical abilities and interests and my desire to have social impact. But immersed in the world of academia, at an institution without a school of public health, and with mentors who had all chosen routes in biotech or academia, it was really hard to learn more about my options for pivoting to a career in public health.

For white people like me, today is about recognizing and reflecting on the anti-Black racism in our society, and committing to specific actions toward ending white supremacy. One of my actions for today is to publicly reflect on how our work at <a href="www.biobot.io">Biobot Analytics</a> contributes to addressing – and potentially perpetuating – racism in public health.

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>When I was on my <a href="https://cduvallet.github.io/travel/">cross-country road trip</a> last year, I kept track of a lot of things in the hopes of doing amazing analyses when I got back. Turns out having a job as a data scientist makes it a lot harder to find time to do data science on the side, and so I’ve only really gotten a chance to look into my <a href="2019/07/road-trip-expenses-pt1">expenses</a>. One of the things I had really wanted to do was make a map of all the places I went, but I didn’t actually know how to work with geospatial data in Python yet. I had this grand idea that I’d learn spatial data techniques while on my trip, but turns out hiking, drinking beer while watching the sunset, and going to bed early were way more compelling ways to spend my time. Luckily for me, one of the most fun parts of my new job has been learning geospatial coding and plotting techniques. I’ve been having fun with it in my job, and I realized that it also means I get to finally make my map!

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>During my PhD, I performed a lot of exit interviews with graduating students and learned that finding a job is often the most stressful part of graduating, and among the most stressful in the entire PhD. After my own defense, however, I was able to avoid some of that stress by discovering a valuable post-PhD job option that I had rarely heard discussed: getting a part-time or consulting gig after graduating to hold you over while you figure out your next full-time non-academic career move.
