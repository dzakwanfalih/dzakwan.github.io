## How to say hello ? 

Hi there! I’m Dzakwan Falih, a graduate student Telkom University in the Faculty of Applied Sience . I am interested in the broader topics of Telecommunication, Malware, mobile programming and solution architect . Currently, I am focused on software define radio, open source mobile communication, and internet of everything. See Current Research Interests.

## Current Research Interests
### Radio Forensic 

The field of digital forensics has expanded to include network forensics as well, and includes such areas of expertise as investigating network security breaches, hacking attempts, and data theft.

With the introduction of computer processing into other devices, such as global positioning system (GPS) units, automobiles, truck black boxes, cellular phones, answering machines, copy and fax machines, and so forth, the field has expanded to add additional subdisciplines.

Each of the subdisciplines can be part of a digital forensic examiner’s expertise, but not all have to be. Some examiners choose to specialize in one area, such as computer forensics, without ever adding cellular phone forensics or GPS to their repertoire of skills.

### Malware 
Malware analysis is the process of understanding the behavior and purpose of a suspicious file or URL. The output of the analysis aids in the detection and mitigation of the potential threat.

Mobile malware is malicious software specifically designed to target mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, with the goal of gaining access to private data.

Although mobile malware is not currently as pervasive as malware that attacks traditional workstations, it’s a growing threat because many companies now allow employees to access corporate networks using their personal devices, potentially bringing unknown threats into the environment.
